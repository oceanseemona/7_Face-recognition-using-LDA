Assignment : Face Recognition using Linear Discriminant Analysis

OBJECTIVE:

• To perform face recognition using Linear Discriminant Analysis on dataset of 40 person which consists of 10 images each and to display the curve between accuracy and m (best components ) while varying the value of k.

DATASET :

• The main folder contains dataset of 40 person, each folder containing 10 images per person.

INSTALL:

This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed :-

>NumPy
command prompt: pip install numpy

>Matplotlib
command prompt: pip install matplotlib

>Jupyter Notebook
command prompt: pip install jupyter

If Python is not installed yet, Anaconda distribution of Python can also be used, which already has the above packages.

OUTPUT:

A curve between accuracy and m (best components) has been displayed, while varying the value of m.
